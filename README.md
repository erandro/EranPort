# [Eran Dromy - Professional Portfolio](https://github.com/erandro)

Hi, my name is Eran and this is my portfolio.
I'm a MERN full stack developer from Chicago with a strong passion for design.
I chose a simple style for this portfolio with the emphasis on HTML and CSS. if you want to see some of my awesome full stack apps - just check my projects in this website (here is the [live link](https://erandro.github.io/EranPort/)) or check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eran-dromy/) page.
